# Robotic_Bat
This bio-inspired robotics project's system model design aims to create a robotic system that simulates the gliding and flapping motions of the Glossophaga soricina bat species. In order to maximize performance in terms of agility, stability, and energy efficiency, the main objective is to simulate the robot's dynamic and physical behaviors.
