## 🚀 Project Overview

This project explores designing and implementing a bio-inspired robotic system mimicking the flight mechanics of *Glossophaga soricina* (Pallas' long-tongued bat). Using adaptive, foldable wings and a gear-driven flapping mechanism, the robot demonstrates versatile gliding and flapping capabilities—providing real-world applications in:

- Drone agility  
- Search and rescue  
- Autonomous navigation in cluttered environments

Developed as a final project at **Arizona State University**, this work blends mechanical design, simulation, and embedded control into a compact robotic platform.

## 🧠 Inspiration

Bats are nature’s masters of agile flight. Unlike rigid-wing drones, bats use:
- **Flexible wing membranes** for dynamic adaptability
- **Gait switching** between gliding and flapping
- **Precise motor control** using minimal energy

This project translates those principles into a robotic prototype through iterative design and testing.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- ✅ **Foldable Wing Design**: Laminated vinyl + flexure structure mimics real bat wing flexibility
- ✅ **Single-Actuator Flapping**: Gear-driven mechanism for efficient motion
- ✅ **Lightweight Build**: Shifted from balsa to 3D-printed PLA for strength and durability
- ✅ **Physics-Based Simulation**: MuJoCo + SolidWorks used to model flight dynamics
- ✅ **Parameter-Driven Optimization**: Data-driven material and design analysis
